## Projects
Some projects I have worked on are confidential in nature, so I will not be able to share specific code or details.  If possible, I will give a brief description.

#### CSAS 2026 Data Challenge - Curling
Stay tuned!  This is getting started, so no code is available yet.  For more info: https://statds.org/events/csas2026/challenge.html

#### 2026 NFL Big Data Bowl
Link to Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/thomasreedy/nfl-big-data-bowl-submission

This project uses Geospatial data from the 2023 season to uncover insights while the ball is in the air.  My submission focuses on how quickly secondary defenders can make productive reactions in chasing down receivers.

#### NCAA Injury Surveillance Dashbaords
Confidential.  We worked with the Datalys Center to create an automated reporting dashboard for their NCAA surveillance data.  Instead of sending out periodic static reports or performing internal analysis from the raw data, authorized users can dynamically retrieve reporting KPIs and uncover additional insights.

#### Live NFL Score Prediction Model

I created a simple model to predict the ending score of a team based on the current score of the game.  Accuracy based on RMSE was within a field goal by half time.  This was deployed in a cloud setting and would stream live NFL play-by-play data for real-time score prediction updates.

#### NCAA Rev-Share Statistical Analysis

I explored, using limited data, how performance of Divsion I NCAA teams impacts revenue changes in subsequent seasons.  I wanted to explore how the House v NCAA decision may impact specific non-revenue sports by looking at how schools handled changes in revenue historically.  I found weak to no results that large fluctions, both positive and negative, in revenue from revenue-generating sports like Football have substantial impacts on funding changes of non-revenue sports.  This does not discredit the threat House has towards funding of NCAA programs, but it calls into question a common saying in college athletics that the success of football teams keeps the non-revenue sports alive instead of other revenue sources like school appropriations or private funding.
