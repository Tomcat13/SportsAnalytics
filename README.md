# Thomas Reedy Sports Analytics
Last Updated 12/11/2025

## About Me
My name is Thomas Reedy, and I am a recent graudate from Indiana University Indianapolis with my Masters in Applied Data Sceience and Sports Analytics.  Sports have always been a huge part of my life (I swam Division I in college and am currently competing in Ironman triathalons), and I am excited to use this passion to deliver value to athletes and organizations. 

## Data Skills and Experience
I have had ample experience in full-stack data workflows from building data pipelines, performing EDA and data cleaning/reconciliation, statistical modeling, machine learning, and deploying my results through dashboards or other applications.  I have used these skills to contibute via internships and graudate projects for the NCAA, NBA teams, USOPC, sports-tech start ups, univeristy teams, data challenges, and graduate courses.
### Tech Stack
- Languages: Python, SQL, R, C++, HTML
- Visualizations: Tableau, Streamlit, Dash
- Data Science and Modeling: Regressions, Clustering, Tree-based models, LLMs with RAG, Neural Networks, Transformer-based models
- Engineering: Azure, Databricks, API integration

## Projects
Some projects I have worked on are confidential in nature, so I will not be able to share specific code or details.  If possible, I will give a brief description.  To see other non-sport specific projects, check out my other repositories.

#### CSAS 2026 Data Challenge - Curling
  
- Link to repo: https://github.com/Tomcat13/CurlingPowerPlay

- This year's CSAS Data Challenge involving timing of the power play in mixed doubles curling.  Team's only get this special play once per game, so they need to make it count.  I analyzed different strategies teams could use along with state-by-state updates on increased (or decreased) likelihood of winning if a power play was used in a given state.  This analysis gave us "rules of thumb" athletes and coaches can use in real-time such as not sacrificing a point to retain the power play late in the game or using the power play early in the game if you have incurred large losses.

#### 2026 NFL Big Data Bowl
- Link to Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/thomasreedy/nfl-big-data-bowl-submission

- This year's prompt was to use Geospatial data from the 2023 season to uncover insights while the ball is in the air.  My submission focuses on how quickly secondary defenders can make productive reactions in chasing down receivers after a QB has thrown the ball.  This metric calculates the time it takes a defender to accelerate in a specific direction, measuring the defenders intent alongside a physical reaction time.  This addresses the situational shortcoming of a physically talented athlete with inneficient movements underpreforming relative to a slower athlete who is more effecient with his movement.

#### NCAA Injury Surveillance Dashbaords
- Confidential.  We worked with the Datalys Center to create an automated reporting dashboard for their NCAA surveillance data.  Instead of sending out periodic static reports as a pdf or performing internal analysis from the raw data, authorized users can dynamically retrieve reporting KPIs and uncover additional insights through an interactive UI.  The architecture used a periodically changing csv file as an input and the output was a dynamic, interactive Dash application.

#### Live NFL Score Prediction Model
- Link to repository: https://github.com/Tomcat13/NFLLivePrediction

- I created and optimized a random forest model to predict the ending score of a team based on play-by-play data from a game.  Accuracy of this model based on RMSE was within a field goal by half time, showing remakably high accuracy for the limited contextual data present.  This model was deployed in a cloud setting and would stream live NFL play-by-play data for real-time score prediction updates.

#### NCAA Rev-Share Statistical Analysis
- Link to file: https://rpubs.com/tbreedy/1240450

- I explored, using limited data, how performance of Divsion I NCAA teams impacts revenue changes in subsequent seasons.  I wanted to explore how the House v NCAA decision may impact specific non-revenue sports by looking at how schools handled changes in revenue historically.  I found weak to no results that large fluctuations, both positive and negative, in revenue from revenue-generating sports like Football have substantial impacts on funding changes of non-revenue sports.  This does not discredit the threat House has towards funding of NCAA programs, but it calls into question a common saying in college athletics that the success of football teams keeps the non-revenue sports alive instead of other revenue sources like school appropriations or private funding.
